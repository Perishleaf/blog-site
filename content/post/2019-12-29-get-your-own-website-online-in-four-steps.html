<p>I like to collect blog websites that have nice design or interesting topics. Not only does the website itself attract me, but also people who built the website. I admire them for spending time on designing their own website and publishing contents constantly. I always imagine how nice it will be if I can build a blog website for myself one day. However, I always flinched at the complex knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. Recently, I revisited one of the blogs by <a href="https://yihui.org/">Yihui Xie</a>, who is an active software engineer working in RStudio and the author of many popular R packages, including the one we are going to introduce in this post, blogdown. I was deeply touched by one of his words, which he distilled from <a href="https://cscheid.net/">Carlos Scheidegger</a>.</p>
