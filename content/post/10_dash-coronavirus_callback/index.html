<p>Last week, I shared with you how to make a <a href="https://dash-coronavirus-2020.herokuapp.com/">dashboard</a> to track the spread of coronavirus using Dash in python, from which you can have a real-time overview of the numbers of global coronavirus cases, including confirmed, recovered and deaths cases, and their distribution on a world map.</p>
<p>As for the first version, we implemented basic dash functions and obtained a static application interface. In other words, except for the native interactions offered by <code>plotly</code> (<em>e.g. hover text display and map exploration on graphs</em>), all content displayed on screen are set once the application is lunched on user’s browser. Users may finish using the dashboard within a couple of seconds and bounce away.</p>
<p>As a web-application in general, a leading indicator of its overall health is engagement rate, which represents the percentage of users who remain active within your application over a defined period of time. This is particularly crucial for commercial web-application that depends on steady user stream to generate revenue (<em>Of course this is not the purpose of my dashboard application, however, to lead to the topic of this post, let’s pretend we are building a “commercial application” for now</em>). One simple and effective way to increase the engagement rate of a web-application is to elevate its interactivity with user.</p>
<p>As you can see, compared to the first version (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-dashboard-to-track-the-spread-of-coronavirus-using-dash-90364f016764">heading figure</a> in my last post), a data table is placed next to the map in the latest version of the 2019-nCoV tracking dashboard (Figure 1). Two types of interactivity are added along with this data table, 1. user can sort rows by any one of the four columns (i.e. Country/Region, Confirmed, Recovered, and Deaths); 2. map will update automatically to a zoom-in view of the Country/Region once user select a row in the table (<em>e.g. when select “Mainland China”, map will zoom into China and show cases numbers of each province</em>). <img src="Figrue1.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>
<p>These two features may help to retain users within the dashboard for a longer time as results displayed on the map can be based on their own interest and selection.</p>
<p>In this post, I will share with you how to achieve aforementioned interactivity using <strong>callbacks</strong> in dash. As usual, you can access all required data and the jupyter notebook from my <a href="https://github.com/Perishleaf/data-visualisation-scripts/blob/master/dash-2019-coronavirus/dashboard-callback-virus.ipynb">Github</a>.</p>

<h3>What is callbacks in dash</h3>
<p>In dash, a <code>callback</code> can be understood as a two-way tunnel linked between python function and the application.</p>
<p>Specifically, two types of cargo, <code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code>, are delivered inside a <code>callback</code> from two directions, <code>Input</code> is the cargo delivered from <code>app</code> to <code>function</code>, which generated via user’s actions in the app (<em>e.g. input a value, select a row, select a item from dropdown menu, hover cursor above a scatter point etc.</em>). Reversely, <code>Output</code> is the cargo from <code>function</code> to <code>app</code>, which returned by the <code>function</code> based on <code>Input</code>.</p>
<p>Both <code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code> have two arguments, <code>component_id</code> and <code>component_property</code>. <code>component_id</code> ensures <code>callback</code> to identify right sender and receiver while <code>component_property</code> is the entity of cargo. That said, based on these <code>component_id</code>, <code>callback</code> knows which component should be monitored for its <code>component_property</code> as <code>Inpu</code>t and to which component should be assigned the <code>component_property</code> returned from <code>function</code> as <code>Output</code>.</p>
<p>In the following example adopted from <a href="https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started-part-2">Dash tutorial</a>, we can see that the two components (<em>i.e. <code>dcc.Input()</code> and <code>html.Div()</code></em>) within the <code>html.Div()</code> container each has an <code>id</code>. These two ids have assigned to <code>Output</code> and <code>Input</code> in the <code>callback</code>, respectively. Consequently, value input by user (<em><code>value</code> property of <code>dcc.Input</code> with <code>id</code> as ‘my-id’</em>) will be passed to <code>update_output_div(input_value)</code> and the returned result will be assigned to <code>children</code> property of <code>html.Div()</code> with <code>id</code> as ‘my-div’.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output

external_stylesheets = [&#39;https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css&#39;]

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)

app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Input(id=&#39;my-id&#39;, value=&#39;initial value&#39;, type=&#39;text&#39;),
    html.Div(id=&#39;my-div&#39;)
])

@app.callback(
    Output(component_id=&#39;my-div&#39;, component_property=&#39;children&#39;),
    [Input(component_id=&#39;my-id&#39;, component_property=&#39;value&#39;)]
)
def update_output_div(input_value):
    return &#39;You\&#39;ve entered &quot;{}&quot;&#39;.format(input_value)

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    app.run_server(debug=True)</code></pre>
<p>Most importantly, <code>callback</code> monitors the <code>input</code> cargo traffic in real-time. As in above example, <code>update_output_div(input_value)</code> is triggered once there is a change inside the input box and the <code>children</code> content updates immediately (Figure 2). This feature enable users to see feedbacks from the application immediately after making an action. <img src="Figure2.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>
<p>You may notice that the <code>component_property</code> is just the property of a given component, which means that we can return any properties of a component via a callback function.</p>
<p>Once we figured out the concept of <code>callback</code> in dash, let’s dive into the code of my dashboard.</p>
</div>
<div id="callback-in-this-dashboard" class="section level3">
<h3>Callback in this dashboard</h3>
<p>Here I first added one more <code>html.Div()</code> (<strong>Figure 3, line523-line563</strong>) sub-container inside the container where the map resides. Within this sub-container, there are two components, <code>html.H5()</code> for the title and <code>dash_tale.DataTable()</code> (**<a href="https://dash.plot.ly/datatable">Dash DataTable</a> is an interactive table component designed for viewing, editing, and exploring large datasets) for the data table.</p>
<p>Still remember the first type of interactivity, the sorting function? This one is simple, it can be directly set by <code>sort_action</code> (<strong>line536, it enables data to be sorted on a per-column basis, which accepts any one value of <code>none</code>, <code>native</code> and <code>custom</code></strong>) within DataTable component. Here we just used <code>native</code>, which sorts data based on their types (<strong>e.g. ascending for number and alphabet for string</strong>).</p>
<p>To be able to select row in the DataTable, we also need to set <code>row_selectable='single'</code> (<strong>line534</strong>), the selection UI will then display in front of each row of data.</p>
<p>As for the map component (<strong>i.e, <code>dcc.graph()</code></strong>), you can find that its <code>id</code> is ‘datatable-interact-map’ (<strong>line519</strong>) while the DataTable component with an <code>id</code> of ‘datatable-interact-location’ (<strong>line529</strong>). These are two ids used in the callback. I like to use meaningful id names which helps to maintain the code in future.</p>
<p>Alright, everything in the app side is ready, now let’s move to the callback part. In our case, as the <code>Input</code> cargo, we have <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows</code> (<strong>this is not an arbitrary name, it is a list of index of select row for <code>dash_table.DataTable</code> component</strong>) from DataTable, the cargo will then deliver to the function to return a <code>figure</code> property for <code>dcc.graph()</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, as shown in <code>Figure 4</code>, we assigned corresponding <code>id</code> to <code>Output</code> and <code>Input</code>, in the meantime, tagged correct property for callback to monitor. Note that Input must be in a list. <img src="Figure4.png" alt="Figure 4" /></p>
<p>Last, let’s finish the function side. The interactivity we want is to let user to select one row from the DataTable, map will then automatically move to and zoom-in the selected Country/Region. In addition, at the start of the application, the initial center point and zoom-level should show the whole world map.</p>
<p>Callback and its function will be called when the application is first time initiated. However, when the application is first rendered, there is no row is selected, hence <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows</code> will be <code>None</code>. This may cause issue for the function relies on <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows</code>. That is why you can see from line590 to line591 (Figure 5), at the beginning of the function, we set <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows</code> as an empty list. Once user made a selection, the index of the selected row of the DataTable will be stored inside <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows</code>. As we only enabled single selection, it will contain only one item. To access this index, we hence just need to call <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows[0]</code>. <img src="Figure5.png" alt="Figure 5" /></p>
<p>By using the <code>go.layout.mapbox.Center()</code> (<strong>Figure 5, line639–641</strong>), we can specify coordinates where map should be centered and its zoom-in level. Thus, when the application is first launched and the <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows</code> is an empty list, we will use predefined coordinates and zoom-in level. Once there is a selection inside <code>derived_virtual_selected_rows</code>, callback will update the map with corresponding coordinates and zoom-in level.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>lat=3.684188 if len(derived_virtual_selected_rows)==0 else dff[&#39;lat&#39;][derived_virtual_selected_rows[0]]
lon=148.374024 if len(derived_virtual_selected_rows)==0 else dff[&#39;lon&#39;][derived_virtual_selected_rows[0]]
zoom=1.2 if len(derived_virtual_selected_rows)==0 else 4</code></pre>
<p>Hurray, we now add two types of interactivity for the dashboard using callback. I hope you find this post useful and now have an idea about callback in dash.</p>
