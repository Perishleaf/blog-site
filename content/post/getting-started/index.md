I have been studying the [IBM Data Science course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) from Coursera for the past several months. After learning all essential skills and tools in Python for this course, here comes the final assignment. The goal of this assignment is to define a business problem related to the city of my choice and then solve it by using the [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) location data.

Although this is an assignment, it closely resembles a real-world problem in which a data analyst would be required to solve in his/her daily job, which involves **problem definition**, **data collection**, **data cleaning**, **data analysing**, **data visualisation**, and **report forming**. Throughout the assignment, I used web-crawling, missing value imputation, Foursquare API, Folium map and k-mean clustering.
I hope you will either gather information or find useful data from this post. Please feel welcome to leave any suggestions and comments. Detailed codes/notebooks/data can be also found [here](https://github.com/Perishleaf/applied-data-science-capstone).
