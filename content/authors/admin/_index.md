I received my Ph.D. from University of New South Wales. I am passionate to deal with complex data and apply data insights to tell stories and solve problems. I am enthusiastic about leveraging methods from modern statistics and data visualisation to decipher patterns from intertwined datasets. I also have a strong interest in machine learning.
